<h2>What is this website?</h2>
<p>For now this blog is my [locus communis](<a class="m-link-wrap" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locus_communis">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locus_communis</a>), an open book for ideas. This is also a journal about my path into technology and philosophy. Maybe you agree with them, maybe not. Just try to be constructive in your opinions, without using pejorative language.</p>
<p>Please take into consideration that English is my second language and maybe you will find the construction of some sentences a little bit odd.</p>

<section id="and-why-are-you-charing-this">
<h2>…and why are you charing this?</h2>
<p>I want to find people with a common interest and share opinions about the subjects mentioned here. A second reason is to leave a piece on my mind here, as an echo of who I am and what I thought.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes I found useful knowledge on the Internet that I want to share in a blog format, following the [KISS principle!](<a class="m-link-wrap" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle</a>). I’ll try to keep it short too, 5 to 10 minutes reading per post with some exceptions from time to time.</p>

<section id="who-am-i">
<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I was a university professor for 10 years, teaching Calculus, Geometry, Topology, Computer Graphics, Digital Image Processing, and Modern Algebra.</p>
<p>After those years, I switched to work in the private sector I have been working there for over a decade. I have used many hats (front developer, back developer, web developer, machine learning engineer, data engineer, data architect, and roles as a leader (Scrum Master, Data &amp; Analytics Lead, Chief Data Architect, Data and Analytics Manager, etc).</p>
<p>But, in the end, I didn’t find myself in the corporate world so now, to be honest, <strong>I want to focus exclusively on those things that I like the most and share my experience with others</strong>. I hope you find the contents of this blog useful in some way.</p>
<p>That’s all… thanks and I’ll see you when I see you…</p>
